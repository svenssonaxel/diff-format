Test directories are three-digit numbers.

Filename schema inside test directories:
- `/[a-z]/`:
  A directory containing a version of data
- `<NN>-<A>-<B>.<TYPE>.diff`:
  A diff file comparing versions `<A>` and `<B>`.
  `<NN>` is for ordering.
  `<TYPE>` can be:
  - `compat`: A correct compat diff format file.
  - `hintful`: A correct hintful diff format file.
  - `unified`: A correct unified diff format file.
  - `invalid.compat`: A file that should not pass validation for compat diff format.
  - `invalid.hintful`: A file that should not pass validation for hintful diff format.
  - `invalid.unified`: A file that should not pass validation for unified diff format.

Test directories and what they focus on, files and what they test:
- `001/`:
  A simple example.
  - `a/`:
    Before change.
  - `b/`:
    After change.
  - `01-a-b.hintful.diff`:
    Simple minimized example, uses `#` for intermediate state.
  - `03-a-b.hintful.diff`:
    Less than minimized example.

    More readable line ordering.
